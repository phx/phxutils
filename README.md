# shell_utils

This is going to be a handy little repo where I maintain some of useful scripts
that I use on a regular basis.  I have a private repo where I have maintained
most of these scripts for a long time, but some of them could prove useful to the
general public, and half the time I forget what they do and end up re-writing them.

This repo will be a place for me to keep them up-to-date and document what they do.

The structure that I'm going to try to create will be an individual folder for each
script with a `README.md` documenting what the script does.  Additionally, there
will be a `bin` directory where I will try to symlink all of the actual scripts
for easy importing into your `$PATH`.

For more information, browse to the subfolders to view the individual README files.
