# debupdate

These are just a couple of scripts that I use to update my Ubuntu servers, because `ansible` consistently fails to provide decent results in this aspect.

`debupdate` can be run locally.

`remote-debupdate` takes multiple host, ip, or `user@ip` strings for arguments of which systems to run a remote `dist-upgrade` on.
